// FAQs about our approach
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How is your approach different from conventional healthcare?",
    answer: "Conventional healthcare often treats symptoms in isolation with different specialists working separately. Our Five Healers approach addresses root causes through a collaborative team of experts who work together on your case, creating a truly holistic treatment plan that addresses all aspects of your health simultaneously."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to believe in Ayurveda for this to work?",
    answer: "Not at all. While our approach incorporates Ayurvedic wisdom, it's integrated with modern science and nutrition. Many of our clients come with no prior knowledge of Ayurveda and experience significant benefits. We focus on practical results rather than requiring any particular belief system."
  },
  {
    question: "How long before I see results?",
    answer: "Most clients begin noticing initial improvements within 7-14 days of starting their protocol. These early changes might include better sleep, improved digestion, or increased energy. More significant transformations typically unfold over 1-3 months, depending on your condition and consistency with the protocol."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I need to make drastic lifestyle changes?",
    answer: "We believe in sustainable transformation, not extreme measures. Your protocol will be designed to work with your lifestyle, gradually introducing changes at a pace that works for you. Our goal is to help you create lasting habits that feel supportive rather than restrictive."
  },
  {
    question: "How do the five healers collaborate on my case?",
    answer: "After your initial assessment, your five healers meet to discuss your case and create an integrated treatment plan. They continue to communicate regularly throughout your healing journey, adjusting your protocol as needed based on your progress and feedback. This ensures all aspects of your treatment work in harmony."
